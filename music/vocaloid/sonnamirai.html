dhiire dhiire se GHaayab hote ja raha
maere andar thi jo aag phir bhi na bujh saka<sup>[1]</sup>
haN, guzarjaane ki aarzu na guzri kabhi, lekin
zindagi meN hi phasa raha

jab kuch yaad aaye to pii ke nashe meN bhuul gaya<sup>[2]</sup>
agle din maeN phir se pii ke nashe meN ghul gaya<sup>[2]</sup>
na badalne ka sapna to raha naakaamiyaab
lamba safar hae iska<sup>[3]</sup>

kya huwa, itna GHamgiin, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana? 
kya tha wo, kya ho gaya, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana?
paas mere, the hamesha, sapne ummiideN kitne lekin
kyuN aesa? tang hogaya! parva nahi raha ab kisi chiiz ka

ghaDi ka kaaTa ghuumte hi gaya cell ke bina<sup>[4]</sup>
khaDe rehne ki koshish meN bhi paeroN ka chalna<sup>[5]</sup>
bas badan baDhe, bachpan ka hi dil bacha rahe<sup>[6]</sup>
thi ye hi ek tamanna

kya huwa, itna GHamgiin, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana? 
kya tha wo, kya ho gaya, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana?
sapnoN meN jo dekhta tha, baDi intezaar se, kya itna hi? 
dil ko kya afsos huwa, baDe hogaye ham jab maalum paDa

maeN tumko, dekha to, hasi aayi
tum mujhko, dekhe to, hasi aayi
haN tum bhi, aor maeN bhi,
guzre din, aor aage bhi<sup>[7]</sup>
phir waapas na aayinge

kya huwa, itna GHamgiin, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana? 
kya tha wo, kya ho gaya, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana?
paas mere, the hamesha, sapne ummiideN kitne lekin
kyuN aesa? tang hogaya! parva nahi raha ab kisi chiiz ka

kya huwa, itna GHamgiin, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana? 
kya tha wo, kya ho gaya, ki aaj ka maeN jo aesa bana?
sapnoN meN jo dekhta tha, baDi intezaar se, kya itna hi? 
dil ko kya afsos huwa, baDe hogaye ham jab maalum paDa

<h2>Translation notes:</h2>
<pre style="font-family:Times New Roman, Sanskrit Text, Jameel Noori Nastaleeq, serif">
I wish Urdu/Hindi had better ways of talking about the past and future. I couldn't find a good way to translate the title ('Such a Future'). There's 'bhavishya' which I think feels more like 'fortune', or 'mustaqbil' which no one actually uses in real life afaik.

<sup>[1]</sup>"'aag na bujh saka'? umm akchyually 'aag' is feminine so it should be 'bujh saki-'" shut up. Poetic license. I want to make this rhyme ðŸ˜­

<sup>[2]</sup>The original mentions drinking and throwing up - a visceral imagery of removing your inner contents, and by extension, your memories, from yourself. When translated literally this didn't really fit the beat, so I tried to convey this with 'nashe meN ghul jaana' - getting dissolved and thus losing yourself in drink. I think the meaning is conveyed well, but the tone does suffer as a result. Oh well, you can't have everything.

<sup>[3]</sup>Here the original says 'it's come a long way', which I translate as 'lamba safar hae' - which looks like I reversed the tense for no reason. But if I instead did 'lamba safar tha', somehow it makes it sound like the journey is over, which I feel is at odds with what the original is trying to get across.

<sup>[4]</sup>English loanword here, 'cell' referring to a battery. This is the word I used growing up, not sure if everyone uses it.

<sup>[5]</sup>I admit this line is phrased a little awkwardly. This is all I could come up with, though.

<sup>[6]</sup>The original uses 'brain', while I translate it into 'heart' ('dil'), which I think is more appropriate than a word like 'dimaaGH'. You could think of it as the nuance between 'brain' and 'mind'.

<sup>[7]</sup>Here again I found it very awkward to render simple words like 'past' and 'future', having to resort to circuitous phrasing. I'm not quite satisfied with it but I also don't see a good solution.

<h2>Literal re-translation:</h2>
<pre>
slowly, slowly, I am disappearing
still, the fire inside me couldn't go out
indeed, my wish to pass away never passed, and yet
I am stuck in life

when I remember, I drink and forget in my drunkenness
the next day, again, I drink and melt away into my stupor
my wish to never change never succeeded
it has a long journey

what happened that was so sorrowful, that the me of today turned out like this?
what was it, what happened, that the me of today turned out like this?
I always had so many dreams and hopes, but
why is it I'm sick of it all? I no longer care about anything

the clock hand kept spinning without batteries
the movement of my legs even in my attempt to stand still
would that only my body grew, while my heart remained that of a child
this was my one desire

what happened that was so sorrowful, that the me of today turned out like this?
what was it, what happened, that the me of today turned out like this?
that which I used to look forward to in my dreams, is this all it is?
what regret struck my heart, when I realised that we grew up

when I looked at you, I laughed
and when you looked at me, you laughed
yes, you, and me too,
the days past, and what is ahead as well
they will never return again

what happened that was so sorrowful, that the me of today turned out like this?
what was it, what happened, that the me of today turned out like this?
I always had so many dreams and hopes, but
why is it I'm sick of it all? I no longer care about anything

what happened that was so sorrowful, that the me of today turned out like this?
what was it, what happened, that the me of today turned out like this?
that which I used to look forward to in my dreams, is this all it is?
what regret struck my heart, when I realised that we had grown up
