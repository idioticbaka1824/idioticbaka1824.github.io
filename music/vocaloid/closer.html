<h2>Lyrics:</h2>
<pre>
hamaare aas paas jo bhi hae
rakhna KHayaal se zaruuri hae, nai to
zyaada qariib agar hogaye
to dikhaai nahiN dene ka hae KHaof

zara sa tum socho, yaad karo
ki kab kya KHushi mili tumko
ya KHush-nasiib ho itne ki
itna bhi nahi yaad aa raha?

zindagi jo jii rahe ho tum
saaNs jo le sakte ho tum
itni bhi si chiiz ko samajh lo ki
ye hae ek karishma!

hamaare aas paas jo bhi hae
rakhna KHayaal se zaruuri hae, nai to
zyaada qariib agar hogaye
to dikhaai nahiN dene ka hae KHaof

you know the closer you get to something
the tougher it is to see it
and I'll never take it for granted

"lage raho, apne sapne sach karo"
"mehnat karo, kabhi haar na maano"
ye sundar se baateN haeN lekin
sun kar faayda hua kya kisi ko?

ek muTThi bhar haosla ko dil meN rakh leke
kal ka din bhi paar ho jaayega
and I'll never take it for granted
let's go!

<h2>Transliteration notes:</h2>
<pre style="font-family:Jameel Noori Nastaleeq, Sanskrit Text">
t th d dh = त थ द ध = دھ د تھ ت &ensp;(respectively)&ensp;(Urdu is left-to-right here)
T Th D Dh = ट ठ ड ढ = ڈھ ڈ ٹھ ٹ
kh KH = ख ख़ = خ کھ

<h2>Translation notes:</h2>
<pre>
The official English version has some very nice phonosemantic matching on the fourth line - "shi<b>mai sou</b>" --> "in <b>my soul</b>". Unfortunately I wasn't able to do achieve that in my translation. But I did do something similar in the second line with "nai to" (not as prominent or smooth, but yeah).

<h2>Literal re-translation:</h2>
<pre>
whatever the things around us
it's necessary to take care of them, or else-
if you get too close
there's the fear of not being able to see them

think a little, remember
when you had what sort of happiness
or are you so fortunate
that you can't even remember such a thing?

the life that you're living
the breath that you can take
even such a thing, understand that
it is a miracle!

whatever the things around us
it's necessary to take care of them, or else-
if you get too close
there's the fear of not being able to see them

you know the close you get to something
the tougher it is to see it
and I'll never take it for granted

keep at it, make your dreams come true
work hard, don't ever give up
these are pretty words, but
has hearing them ever helped anyone?

with a fistful of courage put in your heart
tomorrow will be gotten through, too
and I'll never take it for granted
let's go
