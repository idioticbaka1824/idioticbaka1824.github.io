In 2004, independent developer <a href="https://studiopixel.jp/">Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya</a> released a free game called <a href="https://www.cavestory.org/">Cave Story</a>. He also made a custom music-making software specifically for making the music in this game, called <a href="https://www.cavestory.org/pixels-works/org-maker.php">Organya Maker</a>, or 'Org Maker' for short. This 16-bit software, albeit somewhat limited, is very easy to learn and use. While I have no experience or knowledge of music theory, I have attempted to make some 'sound doodles' with this software. <a href="org-index.html">
<br><br><i>You can listen to them here.</i></a>
<br><br>
You can also play .org files from external sources by inputting the direct URL, if so desired. Unfortunately for some reason most sites won't work, the only file upload site I've found that works for this is <a href="https://filegarden.com/">File Garden</a>.
